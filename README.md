About Our App
The BlueSteps mobile app, developed as part of the We BLUE Erasmus+ project, 
aims to provide information about marine life and the seas in the participating countries of Turkey, Portugal, Greece, and Bulgaria.

What Benefits Do We Provide to Users?
As you navigate through the app, you'll learn about marine life and the sea. We aim to provide insights into what threatens them and how we can protect them. 
This information will be useful for people to use in their daily lives. Today, our seas are becoming increasingly polluted, 
posing a threat to our marine life and leading to its extinction. As humans, 
we must protect our seas and these creatures by protecting our nature.
